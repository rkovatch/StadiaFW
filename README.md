# StadiaFW
Another Google Stadia Bluetooth and Wi-Fi firmware dump. </br>

So, Google did something right in the unfortunate shutdown of Stadia. </br>
They released a bluetooth low-energy firmware update for the controllers! That means less e-waste! <br> However, there's a caveat, the tool will be shutdown *eventually*, December 31st, 2023. <br>

While sure, they've released a tool in the first place, we need to preserve these files. <br>
Contained in this dump are the `bruce` (bluetooth) and `flashloader` bins. <br>
Unfortunately, during my venture I was **not** able to obtain the `gotham` (wi-fi) dvt & prod bins. <br>
In the meantime, however, I had found links for o.t.a. gotham bins. <br>
All of these bins (excluding the gotham bins) were found via:  </br>
https://stadia.google.com/controller/app_combined.js  </br>

Gotham bins obtained via these links:  </br>
